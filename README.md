# Sales Revenue Forecasting with Prophet

## Description
This project develops a time-series model to forecast daily sales revenue for the next 365 days. The model is built to understand seasonal trends and the impact of special events on sales.

## Key Features
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Predicts future sales based on historical patterns.
- **Custom Event Modeling:** Incorporates business events like product launches and promotions to improve forecast accuracy.
- **Component Analysis:** The model breaks down the forecast into trend, weekly, and yearly seasonality.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Prophet (by Facebook)**
- **Matplotlib**

## How to Run
This project is a self-contained Google Colab notebook (`SalesForecastingWithProphet.ipynb`). It generates its own sample data and can be run from top to bottom without any setup.

## Result
The model successfully generates a sales forecast for the next year, visualized with uncertainty intervals and component breakdowns for trend and seasonality.
